# Docking-The-inhibition-of-COX-2-by-CELEBREX

A Quick tutorial on the docking of a enzyme with a small molecule, though the use of the following software: 
1) ROSETTA-4 (Modelling software)
2) Pyrosetta and PyrosettaTools (Graphical User Interface)
3) PyMOL (a GUI and molecule visual aid) 

and databases

1) The Protein Data Bank archive (PDB)
2) The Drugbank database

We will be covering the whole precess, from compilation to the analisys of the results.
