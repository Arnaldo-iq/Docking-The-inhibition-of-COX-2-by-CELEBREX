# Docking-The-inhibition-of-COX-2-by-CELEBREX

A Quick tutorial on the docking of a enzyme with a small molecule, though the use of the following software: 
1) ROSETTA-4 (Modelling software: https://www.rosettacommons.org/software)
2) Pyrosetta and PyrosettaTools (Graphical User Interface: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066856)
3) PyMOL (a GUI and molecule visual aid: https://pymol.org/2/) 

and databases

1) The Protein Data Bank archive (PDB: https://www.wwpdb.org/index)
2) The Drugbank database (https://www.drugbank.ca/)

We will be covering the whole precess, from compilation to the analisys of the results.
